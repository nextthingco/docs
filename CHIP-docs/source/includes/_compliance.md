##FCC

**FCC ID: 2AF9F-HELLA1337**

This device complies with part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject to the following two conditions: 

1. This device may not cause harmful interference. 
2. This device must accept any interference received, including interference that may cause undesired operation.

C.H.I.P. has FCC Modular Transmitter certification meaning any product with C.H.I.P. as the only active radio transmitter will not require your company to run certification testing for the Intentional Radiator portion of FCC tests. When you list that your product contains our FCC-ID'd module you avoid the need to apply for a new FCC-ID.

This greatly lessens the workload of taking your product through FCC certification. Your product will probably still need to be tested and state compliance with FCC Part 15 Class A or B for Unintentional Radiation limits.
