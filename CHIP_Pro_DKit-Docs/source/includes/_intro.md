The C.H.I.P. Pro Developer's Kit provides a complete electronic sandbox to test, iterate, and prototype products with the C.H.I.P. Pro module. While many developer's kits assume a high-degree of technical experience, we make this kit approachable, compact, and easy to use. 
We believe that great products can come from many backgrounds, so we provide several extras in this kit that help you get making and get comfortable. We even include an extra C.H.I.P. Pro to get you started on your own PCB. If you do know it all, you'll find this documentation will help your product be the best it can be whether you're making 1 or 1 million.
