# Workshop Materials

Would you like to run a workshop using PocketC.H.I.P.? In this section you will find materials for use in the classroom or to use while developing your own curriculum. We've created introductions to PocketC.H.I.P. and Pico-8 so you get comfortable with basic operations and commands before running a lesson. We have also created several activities to start with that can be used either together or taught as separate modules. Included are editable files so you can customize the lessons or grab what assets you would like to use for your own. If you don't see a file format that's helpful to you reach out to docs@nextthing.co and let us know what you need.

All use the application [Pico-8](https://docs.nextthing.co/pocketchip.html#pico-8), the fantasy console used to play, create, and share games that comes installed on every PocketC.H.I.P.. Pico-8 has proven to be excellent for learning exercises emphasizing programming and game design skills. 



## Getting Started
These introductory materials are written for educators but can also be used in educational material for students. They will teach you the basics needed in order to lead an activity using PocketC.H.I.P. and Pico-8.
